My favourite book is  The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain.
It is one of my favourite books because it was the first novel I ever back when I was in 4th standard.
It holds a special place in my heart because it was gifted by my cousin. The plot of the story is intriguing and keeps the reader bound to the book.
